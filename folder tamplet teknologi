The term “template” is used in different ways when working with WordPress themes:

Templates files exist within a theme and express how your site is displayed.
Template Hierarchy is the logic WordPress uses to decide which theme template file(s) to use, depending on the content being requested.
Page Templates are those that apply to pages, posts, and custom post types to change their look and feel.
In classic themes, Template Tags are built-in WordPress functions you can use inside a template file to retrieve and display data (such as the_title() and the_content()).

In block themes, blocks are used instead of template tags.
